# Super Bowl LVII Prediction
# Skills: Forecasting/Predictive Analytics, Alteryx

This project was created for course BANA 287: The Art & Science of Applied Forecast Modeling at the University of california, Irvine under the guidance of Professors David Savlowitz and Michael Ponton in 2023.

The project prompt is as follows:
Develop a predictive model (as simple or as complex as you wish) that generates a prediction of the final score between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. Said another way, your model should output a prediction of the total points scored by the Kansas City Chiefs and output a prediction of the total points scored by the Philadelphia Eagles. And by default, your model will be predicting the winner of the Super Bowl! The game CAN NOT end in a tie! You can use any processes, methodologies, software, or data sets you wish. You can even ignore the data set we uploaded and utilize your own data. As long as you develop some form of a predictive model and can explain and support the process you used that produces the final score.
